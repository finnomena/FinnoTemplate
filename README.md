Xcode Templates

These templates can be used with Xcode 11.

To install, clone or download this repository. Then place the template to:

```
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates
```
<h6>Create the Templates folder if it doesnâ€™t exist already.<h6>

That's it. Now run Xcode, open project, and create a new file using the new template.
