Xcode Templates

These templates can be used with Xcode 11.

To install, clone or download this repository. Then place the template to:

```
/Users/<User>/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File Templates/<Template Folder>
```

That's it. Now run Xcode, open project, and create a new file using the new template.
